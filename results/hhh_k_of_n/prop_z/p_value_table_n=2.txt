Table of pairwise p-values for conditional prob differences between i,j makes in last 2 shots (NOT adjusting for difficulty)
Using Bonferroni-corrected alpha value of 0.01667

  i,j      0       1       2   
   0       X    0.80135 0.99352
   1       X       X    0.97653
   2       X       X       X   

There is no pair of k-values for which the probability difference is significant
