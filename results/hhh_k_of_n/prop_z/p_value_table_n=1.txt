Table of pairwise p-values for conditional prob differences between i,j makes in last 1 shots (NOT adjusting for difficulty)
Using Bonferroni-corrected alpha value of 0.05

  i,j      0       1   
   0       X    0.99981
   1       X       X   

There is no pair of k-values for which the probability difference is significant
