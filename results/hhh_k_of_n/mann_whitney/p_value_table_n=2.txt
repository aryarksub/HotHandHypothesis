Table of pairwise p-values for conditional prob differences between i,j makes in last 2 shots (NOT adjusting for difficulty)
Using Bonferroni-corrected alpha value of 0.01667 and Mann-Whitney U test

  i,j      0       1       2   
   0       X    0.04452  2e-05 
   1       X       X    0.01262
   2       X       X       X   

k-values for which probability difference is significant: [(0, 2), (1, 2)]
